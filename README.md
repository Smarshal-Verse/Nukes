## Overview

The Nuclear Detonation Detector App is a powerful mobile application designed to detect potential nuclear detonations through a machine learning model. This model is trained using satellite imagery and real-time Twitter news data, providing a comprehensive approach to identifying signs of nuclear detonations. The app strategically deploys the model at railway locations for increased effectiveness.

## Features

1. **Machine Learning Detection**: Utilizes a sophisticated machine learning model trained on satellite imagery and Twitter news data to accurately identify potential nuclear detonations.

2. **Railway Deployment**: The model is strategically deployed at railway locations, enhancing its ability to detect incidents near critical infrastructure.

3. **Real-time Alerts**: Sends immediate alerts to a central server upon detecting a nuclear detonation, ensuring swift notification.

4. **Override Do Not Disturb Mode**: Overrides the device's "Do Not Disturb" mode to deliver critical alerts, ensuring users are notified even in silent or restricted modes.

5. **User-friendly Interface**: Features an intuitive and user-friendly interface for easy understanding and response to alerts.

6. **Location-based Tracking**: Utilizes location services to provide users with information on the proximity of the detected detonation.

## How It Works

1. **Training the Model**: The machine learning model is trained using a combination of satellite imagery and Twitter news data to identify patterns associated with nuclear detonations.

2. **Railway Deployment**: The trained model is deployed at railway locations, taking advantage of their strategic positioning for enhanced detection capabilities.

3. **Real-time Detection**: The model continuously analyzes incoming data for signs of a nuclear detonation. Upon detection, the app sends an alert to the central server.

4. **Alert Notification**: The central server processes the alert and notifies the app, which then overrides the device's "Do Not Disturb" mode to deliver a high-priority alert to the user.

## Disclaimer

The Nuclear Detonation Detector App is designed for informational purposes only. While the machine learning model has been trained on diverse datasets, false positives may occur. Users are encouraged to follow official safety protocols and contact local authorities in the event of an alert.
